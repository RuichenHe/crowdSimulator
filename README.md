# Crowd Simulator 
# [About](https://ruichenhe.github.io/crowSimulator/)
A course project for *CSCI 5611: Animation and Planning in Games*. **crowdSimulator** is full crowd simulation in which multiple agents are being simulated. Each agent in the system has its own goal, and their path are planned so that they can not only reach their goals, but also avoid collisions with each other and the obstacles in the environment. Instead of importing file for scene creation, random scene (both agents locations, and obstacle locations) are generated. Multiple modes are created to simulate different cases. For path planning, a PRM algorithm is implemented (extended from the after-class activity). For anticipatory collision avoidance, the basic TTC force has been implemented (referenced from http://www.gameaipro.com/GameAIPro2/GameAIPro2_Chapter19_Guide_to_Anticipatory_Collision_Avoidance.pdf).
